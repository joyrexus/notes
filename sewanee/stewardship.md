# Natural Area Stewardship

Sewanee's land base is a defining feature of the University and represents a strategic and integral part of its educational mission. We seek to promote sustainable land stewardship through strategies of adaptive management that promote and protect ecological values including biodiversity and ecosystem services in the context of a working educational landscape.

* **Identify, map, and monitor ecological communities and rare species of the Domain and implement protection strategies as necessary.**

* Promote environmentally sensitive recreational use of the Domain.

* Assess, monitor, and promote awareness of the unplanned exploitation of plant and animal species.

* Manage deer population so as to mitigate impacts of overbrowse.

* Limit the ecological impact of invasive species.

* Demonstrate the sustainable harvest of wood products for inclusion in new construction projects to partially offset forest product use on campus.

* Identify areas of the Domain as potential candidates for restoration projects or zones for intensive management activities.

* Mitigate the effects of land use and management on the Domainâ€™s cultural resources.

* Provide leadership on environmental stewardship and sustainability issues beyond the University.
