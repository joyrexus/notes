Also worth viewing is the [Sewanee Natural Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewanee_Natural_Bridge).

The Buggy Top Cave hike leads into Lost Cove, and the entrance is 2 or 3 miles beyond Aerie on the Sherwood Road. (Highway 56). What goes down must come up, and coming UP this trail is tough. But Buggy Top Cave is pretty wonderful. You’ll hike down to a place where you must choose right or left, and you want to check out both. To the left is part of the cave, but not a part you can really see. To the right is the Buggy Top part of the cave, but the last 50 yards are a doozy.

Fiery Gizzard, Foster Falls, Savage Gulf and the Stone Door are all fabulous hikes; I believe there are bathrooms at all trailheads. The Stone Door is paved part of the way and is pretty flat, if you like to see wonderful mountain scenery but aren’t up to a strenuous hike.

The [South Cumberland State Park](http://tennessee.gov/environment/parks/SouthCumberland/) has 10 different areas in four counties. There are some fabulous hikes! The Visitor Center is located between Monteagle and Tracy City on Highway 41.

The [Perimeter Trail](http://www.sewanee.edu/sop/perimetertrail.htm) provides 20 miles of hiking. Access via The Cross, Green's View or Morgan's Steep.

Abbo's Alley is the wooded trail in the middle of Sewanee. It’s not a long hike, but it certainly is beautiful. You can get on it at the bottom of the hill on South Carolina Avenue, the road across from the Chapel. 

Caldwell Rim Trail in Lost Cove is 2.4-mile loop atop the plateau features scenic overlooks, bluff-lines, and a level of difficulty similar to those of Piney Point and Beckwith’s Point trails. The trail begins by following Depot Branch, affording several views of the stream bed and Point Disappointment. The trail then crosses several creeks and follows the bluffline overlooking Lost Cove. The single-track then connects back to a fire lane, allowing hikers to walk two abreast and enjoy conversation for the remainder of the loop. Caldwell Rim Trail is the first addition to a Lost Cove trail system that will provide educational and recreational opportunities for the Sewanee community. The trailhead is off Bob Stewman Road. To get there from University Avenue and the village, cross highway 41 (Sollace M. Freeman Highway) and turn left on Lake O’Donnell Road. Turn right on Bob Stewman Road and follow it to the end; there is a sign pointing you to the right to the parking area.

Mountain Goat Trail stretches between St. Andrew’s-Sewanee School and Cowan. Paved, it parallels highway 41A.
