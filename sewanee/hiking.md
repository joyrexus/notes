Abbo's Alley is the wooded trail in the middle of Sewanee. It’s not a long hike, but it certainly is beautiful. You can get on it at the bottom of the hill on South Carolina Avenue, the road across from the Chapel. 

Caldwell Rim Trail in Lost Cove is 2.4-mile loop atop the plateau features scenic overlooks, bluff-lines, and a level of difficulty similar to those of Piney Point and Beckwith’s Point trails. The trail begins by following Depot Branch, affording several views of the stream bed and Point Disappointment. The trail then crosses several creeks and follows the bluffline overlooking Lost Cove. The single-track then connects back to a fire lane, allowing hikers to walk two abreast and enjoy conversation for the remainder of the loop. Caldwell Rim Trail is the first addition to a Lost Cove trail system that will provide educational and recreational opportunities for the Sewanee community. The trailhead is off Bob Stewman Road. To get there from University Avenue and the village, cross highway 41 (Sollace M. Freeman Highway) and turn left on Lake O’Donnell Road. Turn right on Bob Stewman Road and follow it to the end; there is a sign pointing you to the right to the parking area.

Mountain Goat Trail stretches between St. Andrew’s-Sewanee School and Cowan. Paved, it parallels highway 41A.
