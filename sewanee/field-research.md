# Domain Research

The academic use of the Domain takes many forms: experimentation, natural history study, monitoring, teaching exercises, and demonstration.  The [Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability](http://www.sewanee.edu/offices/oess/domain-research/) (ESS) supports and administers both internal and external use of the Domain for these purposes by maintaining field monitoring equipment, **implementing experimental manipulations**, **acquiring and managing data**, and assisting with fund-raising for research projects. 

ESS maintains a database of all existing projects on the Domain and administers an approval process for reviewing new project requests.

The [Landscape Analysis Lab](http://www.sewanee.edu/offices/oess/landscape-analysis-lab/) (LAL) at Sewanee supports geospatial science education and
Domain research. The LAL is responsible for [developing and managing datasets relevant to Domain research](http://lal.sewanee.edu/digitaldomain).

> Overview of Domain Utilization, the Research Request Process, 
> and the Field Research Committee

It is the responsibility of the newly created office of Environmental Stewardship to track all existing and proposed projects on the Domain and to administer an approval process for reviewing new project requests for field activities and research in the sciences.  This document describes the official University approval process for all new Domain project requests, calls for the establishment of a **Field Research Committee** to review these proposals, and announces the creation of a **Domain Field Research Fund**.   This document and the Field Research Committee supersede all previous processes and committees for Domain research and project review.  

Property zonation and institutionally defined Critical Areas of Inquiry (e.g., watershed science) in the Domain Environmental Stewardship Master Plan will determine land-use research priorities and inform suitability for new proposals.  Field demonstration projects will be co-located into a Demonstration Forest whenever possible to maximize educational benefit from proximity to other projects, but will be conducted under the objectives set forth for the Demonstration Forest.  

Resource management activities will be prioritized to support projects developed under each topical area in support of education and research objectives.  As part of each project proposal review, the University Archaeologist will ensure new proposals will not compromise cultural resources, and the Domain Manager will play a key role in siting research projects and identifying potential conflicts. All projects utilizing the Domain must first be approved by the Director of Environmental Stewardship following review by the Field Research Committee (FRC).  

It is the responsibility of the Office of Environmental Stewardship to track all projects ...
1. to ensure they conform to the expectations set forth in the project proposals
2. to ensure that they adhere to general Domain policies
3. **to provide a comprehensive list of data acquisition efforts on the Domain for future students and faculty.**

The composition of the Field Research Committee will be as follows: 

* Director of Environmental Stewardship (Chair)
* Director of Undergraduate Research
* Director of Sponsored Research

Two Ad Hoc faculty members will be appointed by the Dean of the College to serve on the committee for staggered 2 year terms. All internal and external proposals will be submitted to the committee for review and approval.  The University Archeologist and Domain Manager will serve in an advisory capacity to the FRC and will comment on practical constraints of work proposed and potential land use conflicts (see below).

Site utilization for new class projects and independent studies, field research on the Domain, and University-sponsored projects will follow a site-use request process similar to that used over the past two years by the Domain Stewardship Committee.  The new process outlined below outlines typical expectations for proposal development and review. 

* All research, class or lab projects, consumptive uses, demonstration, and Advancement projects for site request will be submitted to the Director of Stewardship to initiate the FRC review.  **Projects will be entered into the Domain GIS database and tracked for completion by the Office of Environmental Stewardship in coordination with the Landscape Analysis Lab.**  The Director of Environmental Stewardship will present a report annually to the Asst. Provost for Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability regarding educational and site uses. 

* For each new project, a site-use request form (Downloaded from the Stewardship website) will be completed by the principal investigator/project manager and submitted to the Director of Environmental Stewardship for review by the Field Research Committee (FRC).  

* Using a Domain GIS database maintained by the Landscape Analysis Laboratory for this purpose, the Office of Environmental Stewardship will review potential spatial conflicts associated with proposed projects including:

* conflicts with on-going research or demonstration

* cultural resources in the project area (in consultation with the University Archaeologist)

* unique ecological areas, rare species, etc. in the project area
The Office of Environmental Stewardship will provide the FRC with a review of potential conflicts in these three areas.  

* Similar to current procedures, the tiered process of consumptive use and duration of investigation outlined below will continue to determine the complexity of the proposal required for Domain use. 

* All projects with potentially significant political issues or that occupy a footprint of >10ha of the Domain for >5 years will be elevated to the appropriate administrative level for approval with the FRC recommendations. 

* Historically used areas for classes, labs, and student projects will be entered in the database for tracking purposes, but will be asked to provide a more precise geographic foot print to avoid conflicting with future projects. Notification to relevant faculty and departments with class activities will occur when new projects are placed near these historically used areas.


## New Field Project Site-Use Request Process

* Non disturbance/non-consumptive projects of current faculty and staff lasting less than 1 year (e.g., observational studies, lab activities in the field, inventory, etc.) will simply provide notice to the FRC through the existing standard forms (Download) to document the principal investigator, type of project, objectives, methods, and location.  **Objectives for these projects and labs should be measureable and specific, and any planned outcomes (e.g., publications, reports, and archived datasets) will be identified.** 

* The FRC will directly approve these internal proposals of less than 1 year via e-mail after the feasibility and location of the project are determined by the natural and cultural resource criteria above.

* Non disturbance/non-consumptive projects lasting 1-5 years (e.g., observational studies, recurring lab activities, external grants, preliminary data, or extensions of previous short-term projects) will require an expanded proposal of 4-6 pages to include the following common proposal elements: principal investigator/project manager, background/literature review, objectives, technical approach, expected publications, student involvement, and support requirements from the Office of Environmental Stewardship (e.g., support for data downloads during the summer).  As the Stewardship Program matures, these projects may become eligible for internal funding opportunities involving undergraduates, post-baccalaureates, supplies, and internships (See below).

* The FRC will provide the final review of short-term (1-5 year) non-consumptive research projects by working with PIs to iteratively improve proposals.

* Final approval for projects will be provided in writing to designated PI or project manager.  


* Disturbance and consumptive projects outside of the Demonstration Zones, as well as those non-disturbance projects expected to exceed 5 years in duration (long-term research) will produce a full proposal of 6-10 pages to include the proposal elements above.  As the Stewardship Program matures, these projects may also be eligible for internal funding opportunities involving undergraduates, post-baccalaureates, supplies, and internships. **Historic long-term projects are encouraged to supply the expanded proposal for database tracking.**

* Consumptive and long-term research projects will require external review but proposals may include suggested peer-reviewers. Reviewers will be engaged to provide independent anonymous review, and PIs will be required to address comments prior to issuance of funds and/or notice to process. The FRC will determine if proposals have sufficiently addressed external comments in cooperation with the PI. 

* The FRC will provide the final review of short-term (1-5 year) non-consumptive research projects by working with PIs to iteratively improve proposals.

* Final approval for projects will be provided in writing to the PI or project manager.  

* Funds generated by consumptive use will endow support of long-term monitoring and long-term research on the Domain. 

* The terms “consumptive” or “disturbance” simply define activities that place sites along a new ecological trajectory, and represent “opportunity costs” to other activities on that site over the long-term. These activities may include, but are not limited to prescribed fire, firewood harvest, deer exclosures, animal cull, dam removal, timber harvest, etc. 

* The Demonstration Zone will have a separate plan intended to expedite and aggregate small scale projects of this nature.  Nonetheless, new project to the demonstration zones should fit within the plan and objectives established for those zones.  


## Competitive External Grants Proposals 

External competitive proposals (from faculty and staff) should be submitted to the Director of Environmental Stewardship for evaluation of site-use conflicts and internal review by the FRC at least 14 days prior to submission deadline, unless otherwise approved by the Director of Environmental Stewardship.  Criteria for evaluation and need for administrative approval same as outlined above.  At least 2 of the 5 FRC members must review external proposals for rigor, topicality to the CAIs, and the Domain Manager and University Archaeologist must approve of locations requested for Domain use.  Due to time constraints inherent to outside proposals, the FRC must provide comments to PIs within 24 hours of receiving external proposals, with the Assistant Provost for Sustainability and Stewardship serving as an ad hoc reviewer if needed to expedite review and approval. 

* All extramural grants will be considered a priority for placement across the site based on CAI and landscape zoning. 


## Research Funding

*Greater Domain Research Fund, Non Peer-Reviewed Grants, and Advancement Funded Projects*

As funds are raised for the establishment of Domain Field Research Fund, the FRC will meet annually to review proposals for distribution of those funds. Proposal teams are expected to produce a full proposal of 10 pages to include the proposal elements in #2 above.  These projects should include full budgets including costs for involving undergraduates, post-baccalaureates, and internships.   When Advancement works with faculty and staff to secure grants for projects that do not undergo scientific peer review, the following process will typically be used (but may occur after funds are secured in certain situations). 

* Internally funded projects will require external review of full proposals. The FRC will engage the peer-reviewers for a complete anonymous review and will ensure comments are provided in a timely manner to the project team.  PIs will be required to address comments prior to issuance of funds and/or notice to proceed. 

* The FRC will determine if proposals have sufficiently addressed external comments through iterative discussions with the PI/project manager.

* For internally funded projects, statistical analysis and chemical analysis are encouraged to be performed through Sewanee departments and include student involvement wherever possible.  Funding for departmental approval of in-house chemical and statistical analysis should be included in proposal budgets and will enhance competitive status in review of Domain Field Research Fund proposals.


## Other Considerations 

* The Stewardship Master Plan will establish priorities for field studies and research (e.g., long term monitoring, long term research projects, externally funded short-term research projects, student led projects, lab utilization, demonstration).

* **A database of all documented historic and current research project will be maintained by Environmental Stewardship staff and made available to all investigators via the web.**

* If ecological monitoring data are used to supplement projects, designated monitoring PI’s should be notified in advance and publication authorship rules will be developed using established guidelines (e.g., ERIN).  Inclusivity is encouraged and all projects must identify a list of expected peer-reviewed publications and reports prior to release of internal funds. 

* Restricted gifts for departmental research will be reserved for proposals from that department; however, they will be subject to selection through peer review and degree of collaboration within one of the CAIs. Restricted gifts should be related to one of the CAIs topical areas. 

* Each project should include safety or risk management items unique to the proposed work.

* All projects that are performed on the Domain with outside partners or with political sensitivities will be asked by the Director of Environmental Stewardship to provide a separate communications plan detailing the responsibilities of each institution and any messaging for Marketing and Communications before project implementation. The Communications Plan will be provided to the Director of Environmental Stewardship and the Executive Director of Marketing and Communications. 

* This process outlines typical expectations, but the Director of Environmental Stewardship in consultation with the Assistant Provost for Stewardship and Sustainability, and the FRC, may provide flexibility when opportunities for significant fieldwork, grant, or projects cannot conform to these expectations. 

* Prioritization for internally funded research will include multi-investigator, multi-departmental collaborations that have significant undergraduate participation.

* If a new research project’s objectives, treatments, or purpose are considered a follow-up to a previous group’s study, the investigators of the new project should notify the original group.  The original group should be given the opportunity to present data or potential conflicts to the new project group or publish original study data, if possible, before approval of the follow-up or related project.
