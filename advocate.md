I advocate ...
==============


## Open governance

Regulatory transparency, government accountability, and administrative efficiency. All banal but critical. And, yes, much work to be done. How nice it would be if our interactions with government (local, state, federal) felt like an interaction with an ipod: clean, sharp, well designed. We want our “gov” to be a shiny little package, expertly engineered, smoothly functional, and beautiful in its simplicity.


## Visionary minimalism

A progressive mindset that is fallibilist, ironic, irenic, and ameliorative. The minimalist values consensus building and the achievement of incremental improvements over ideological purity. The visionary minimalist shares those values, but will occassionally speak in a prophetic voice to drive such change, holding us accountable for shared ideals that remain unfulfilled.


## A puritan work ethic

The notion of being "called" to a "vocation". This is the idea that we can engage in, identify ourselves with, and dedicate ourselves to a particular form of productive labor that is appropriate to our particular skills and abilities.


## The war against cliché


## A capabilities approach


## Radical transparency


## The bourgeois virtues


## Benedictine piety


## Biedermeir conventionality

Describe Freiherr von Risach, the Rosenhaus, and the ideal of the gentleman Naturalist; the sensibility of Sebald and Stifter, a certain humility, objectivity, and emotional distance; Sebald’s lapidary style.


## Atlantic style civic republicanism

## Producerism, mutualism, and autogestion

Producerism emerged in the late 18th-century as an agrarian and artisinal variant of the civic republicanism that played such an important role in the ideology of the American Revolution. Producer-republicanism celebrated the dignity of productive labor as the source of civic virtue and independent citizenship, and yeoman farmers and skilled artisans formed the backbone of the ideal producerist commonwealth.
