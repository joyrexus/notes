# Open Science

Quotes and extracts from this two-part article: [Building an archaeological project repository](http://blog.okfn.org/2014/02/24/archaeological-repository-open-science-open-data).

We need to go beyond open access to publications (Open Access), to include access
to data and other research outputs (Open Data), and *the process* by which data
is turned into knowledge (Open Science).

This is the essence of Open Science: **exposing the data and processes that allow others to replicate and more effectively build on our science**.

Publicly funded research data should generally be made as widely and freely available as possible in a timely and responsible manner; and, secondly, the research process should not be damaged by the inappropriate release of such data.

This has produced a simple economic issue â€“ if research institutions can not demonstrate that they can manage research data in the manner required by the funding councils then they will become ineligible to receive grant funding from that council. The impact is that the majority of universities are now developing their own, or collaborating on communal, data repositories.

**Individual research projects should not bear the burden of implementing their own data repository framework.** This is much better suited to local or national institutions where the economies of scale come into their own. Yet in 2010 the provision of research data infrastructure [for this particular use case] was either non-existent or poorly advertised. Where individual universities provided institutional repositories, these were focused on publications (the currency of prestige and career advancement) and not on data.
