# S2

[S2](https://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/) is an open-source spherical geometry library written and designed by Eric Veach used for geospatial indexing and manipulating regions on the sphere. S2 seems to be the Holy Grail of geo algorithms for mapping spheres to 1D indexes and being able to do proximity searches.

> Within Google we use a clever library built by Eric Veach to identify regions on the surface of the earth. It internally uses 64 bit numbers to uniquely identify cells, with sizes ranging from millimeters to hundreds of kilometers on a side, using projections of spheres onto the surfaces of cubes, quadtrees, and enumeration of positions on Hilbert space filling curves. This is one of my favorite libraries at Google.  -- [Jeff Dean](https://plus.google.com/+JeffDean/posts/9Moq9wrySy4)
