## XBD

We're pushing the idea of **explorable behavioral datasets**.

We're investigating:

* tooling
* [standards](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/7643968)
* best practices

Currently exploring strategies for the immediate capture and playback of gesture/hand-motion samples, but ultimately interested in techniques for persisting, editing, annotating, and replicating behavioral activity streams in general.


### Why?

The rise of proximal sensors.

They provide a stream of behavioral data that can be ...

* captured
* visualized
* edited
* munged
* analyzed
* replicated


### Relevant Domains

* [motion capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture)
* [motion analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_analysis)

* [motor learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning)
* [motor control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control)


## Tooling

In general, the plan is to build off D3 for visualization/interaction and IndexedDB as a distributed datastore.
