# Geometric Algorithms for GIS

At one point there was a course offered at Duke called [Design and Analysis of Algorithms with Applications in GIS](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~large/Courses/cps296/).  It's particular focus was on I/O-effective algorithms for large-scale problems.

See the [course outline](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~large/Courses/cps296/cps296synopsis.html) and [lecture summary](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~large/Courses/cps296/summary.html).
