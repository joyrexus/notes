# Groundwater Flow

Inspired by the wind flow maps of [Viegas & Wattenberg](http://hint.fm/wind/) and [Cameron Beccario](http://earth.nullschool.net/), I'd like to design a map of the water flow (groundwater flowlines and subsurface flow) in Lost Cove.

Lost Cove is located in Franklin County, TN, near the eastern edge of the Southern Cumberland Plateau.  It's a short walk from the campus of the University of the South, which now manages the land.  In early 2008, Sewanee purchased the Cove's 3,000-acres, with a conservation easement held by The Land Trust for Tennessee.  Under the auspices of Sewanee's Environmental Institute, it now serves as a living laboratory for environmental stewardship, fieldwork, and research.

The Cove contains a large underground watershed with a fluctuating water table, consisting of a complex karst geology.  I've come across some references to work that's already been undertaken to map out its watershed network and flowlines.  See references and extracts below.

For the project I have in mind, the exact representation has yet to be determined.  In fact, the real problem driving this nascent project is that of the representation of natural processes: how to devise representations that are accurate, illuminating, and aesthetically pleasing? In this case, the representation of water flow through a subsurface watershed.

We need to think through the possibilities.  

With [Eduard Imhof](http://www.reliefshading.com/cartographers/imhof/), relief presentation became both a [coherent discipline](http://esripress.esri.com/display/index.cfm?fuseaction=display&websiteID=118) and [high art](http://www.library.ethz.ch/exhibit/imhof/imhof3_e.html).  How might Imhof's cartographic techniques be extended to incorporate the representation of **natural processes** occurring at the surface and subsurface layers?

For this project I'd like to investigate the applicability of some of the relatively recent work that's been done on [algorithms for elevation models](http://www.win.tue.nl/~hermanh/doku.php?id=algorithms_for_geographic_elevation_models) for inferring flow lines.  Some of the innovative techniques coming out of Bernhard Jenny's [Cartography and Geovisualization Group](http://cartography.oregonstate.edu/index.html), extending Imhof's work on terrain rendering, might be useful as well.

> The complex karst geology of Lost Cove, a 39 km2 watershed in the southeast
quadrant of the 7.5â€™ Sewanee, TN Quadrangle, has been mapped using global
positioning systems (GPS), Arcview Geographic Information System (GIS), and
aerial photography. The most prominent sinks and springs in the Mississippian
Monteagle Limestone on the floor of Lost Cove along Lost Creek have been
monitored over the past year to study the effects of a fluctuating water table.
During periods of heavy rain, a rising water table activates ephemeral springs
and streams found throughout the floor of Lost Cove. Most of the water
ultimately reaches the Big Sink, where it drops 40 m over the next 1.2 km in
the Buggytop Cave system and emerges as Crow Creek. Detailed subsurface maps of
the Cove are preliminary, and have not yet demonstrated that all surface water
enters the Buggytop system. Dye tracing in major sinks and springs of a major
tributary, Champion Cove, is underway but has already demonstrated there is no
direct connection between Prince Spring and the major upstream sink to the
northeast. Older dye traces on the eastern end of Champion Cove at Temple Sink
suggest no direct connection to the Lost Cove, Big Sink, or Buggytop systems.
Other groundwater flowlines throughout lower Lost Cove continue to be traced
and mapped. Future work will include a comparison between calculated and
observed recharge and discharge throughout Lost Cove.

> Lost Cove, a topographic depression draining 39 sq km, is located in the
> Sewanee Quadrangle near the eastern edge of the Southern Cumberland Plateau.
> The cove is rimmed by Warren Point Sandstone bluffs of early Pennsylvanian
> age which overlie late Mississippian Pennington and Bangor Limestones. The
> lower slopes and floor of the cove are fossiliferous and oolitic
> Mississippian Monteagle Limestone, and exhibit typical karst features that
> include numerous sinks and springs along Lost Creek and its tributaries.
> Several times in a typical year rainfall exceeds the capacity of the sinks
> for a few days at a time, and an impoundment of up to 10 acres forms adjacent
> to the lowest point within the cove, the Big Sink. The Big Sink/Buggytop cave
> system at the southern end of Lost Cove is the only documented
> joint-controlled karst conduit in the area, but this study also demonstrates
> strong joint control of cave passages in the vicinity of Kirk Spring and
> other openings in the upper Monteagle Limestone near the floor of Lost Cove.
> Surface and subsurface flows in the vicinity of Kirk Spring typically change
> direction over the course of several precipitation events. The strongest
> fracture trends are concentrated at azimuths of 25, 40, and 126 degrees, with
> the 126-degree trend the most consistent throughout the
> Mississippian-Pennsylvanian section. The fieldwork investigates the
> relationship between major fracture trends and the volume and direction of
> flow in sinks and springs at times of drought and high water.
