# The impact of gesture interaction on cognition

While graspable and gesture-based interaction devices need to be easy to use, there is also value in understanding how they affect cognition and how their design can be oriented towards enhancing cognition. The broader goal of this workshop topic is to find underlying relationships between the use of gesture- based computing devices, communication and cognition. This workshop will focus on **the cognitive impact of interaction design that uses gestures as an integral part of the interaction.**

Recent research on gesture and thought has shown that gestures are an aid for thinking and not exclusively an aid for communication.

This workshop will focus on **the interaction design of gesture-based systems, with particular emphasis on how the use of bodily movement affects user thought and action.**

The significant contribution this workshop brings to the CHI community is the establishment of **a research agenda** that emerges from the dialog among the perspectives of the design of gestural interaction and the cognitive science of gesture, with the aim of **fostering new research on how using gesture-based interfaces change cognition.** The major goal of this workshop is **to establish a research agenda around the impact of gesture-based interaction on cognition and the acknowledgement of that impact in the design of new gesture-based interactive systems.**

The specific goals of the workshop are to identify and disseminate research results and an agenda for future; research related to **how gesture-based devices affect cognition and how their design can be responsive to enhancing cognition**; how gesture interaction can enhance creativity and learning; the discovery and definition of a common set of gestures for specific cognitive impact.

The following issues arise when combining gesture, thought and interactions design:

* What are relevant hypotheses for research on these topics?

* What methodologies and statistical significance are needed to move forward in this area? Can we generalize?

* How does the effect of gesture on cognition change the way we design?

* How can research in cognitive science and design be integrated through these topics?

* What methods and approaches have been successful for studying gesture-based thought?
