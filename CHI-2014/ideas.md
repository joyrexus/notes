# On the process of schematization

Marking (literally, "to mark time") is a device that dancers employ to mark particular moments in the dance to save physical effort and commit to memory long passages of choreography.  It enhances the vividness and detail of imagined movement.

Marking involves:
* motor preparation
* spatial planning/sequencing
* proprioceptic monitoring

Marking confers cognitive benefits during the rehearsal process, due to reduction of cognitive load allowing more effective memory encoding.  It helps facilitate muscle memory of details and deeper processing of movement goals.

* Muscle memory refers to the system of motor procedures – motor schemata – that
have been stabilized through practice and are activated during performance.

Marking is a way of priming the neural system of a dancer, thereby enhancing imagination (or projection) by activating cortical elements that would be involved in the full-out movement.  Initial movements prime later movements. 

* Priming refers to an increased sensitivity to a stimulus due to prior exposure to a related stimulus.

By physically executing a synoptic version of the whole phrase – by creating a simplified version externally – dancers are able to understand the shape, dynamics, emotion, and spatial elements of a phrase better than through
imagination alone. They use marking as an anchor and vehicle for thought.

This sort of gesturing providing an anchor for mental projection. Marking a phrase provides the scaffold to mentally project more detailed structure than could otherwise be held in mind.


## Behavioral economy: a geneology of implicature

How do we go about encapsulating meaning?

Let us note that there are degrees of embodiment / encapsulation / grammatization / schematization:

fully-embodied action 
  marking / gesture / diagrams (first stage encoding)
    notation / sign (second stage encoding)

As we encapsulate we reduce cognitive load.  The neural discharge (as it runs through the inferential network) becomes a well-trod route, a pathway, a reflex.

We might call this general line of reflection "Cartesian pragmatics" after Descartes' early insights as articulated in the *Regulae*.
