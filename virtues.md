## Negative capability

"I had not a dispute but a disquisition with Dilke, on various subjects; several things dovetailed in my mind, & at once it struck me, what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in literature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously - I mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason - Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half knowledge. This pursued through Volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates every other consideration."

– Keats (1817)


## Genealogical self-consciousness

This is a sort of Whiggish history where we attempt to tell a coherent, consistent, compelling, cumulative, yet also highly selective and carefully-edited story of who we are and how we have become what we are. Of course, all concept mongering creatures engage in this sort of exercise (isn’t this just what it means to be a “self”?), just not always consciously. What we’re advocating (for our self) is that it be done in a self-aware manner. That is, genealogical self-consciousness is here to be understood as an expressively progressive reconstructive enterprise of reflexive awareness.

"Self-aware self-accounting" or "the craft of self-authorship" are probably better and more concise descriptions.

The baseline task here is the rational rectification of norms: to follow out the unforseen implications of our current commitments and resolve any incompatibilities. While always aiming for completeness, we need to keep in mind that this is a never ending process of unification, revision, and supplementation. For we can always tell a better story. Wisdom is knowing what to throw away and what to creatively re-appropriate ... and realizing at what point you have to stop with the wholesale re-tellings and concentrate on iterative refinements.

The practice of genealogical self-consciousness is a way of creatively tracing out those formative moments that have made us who we are, while simultaneaously projecting our future selves. It enables us to reappropriate the desires that beset us without reflection as self-conscious, purposeful choices. In other words, it is the habit of always taking responsiblity for onseself by consciously assuming certain commitments while rejecting others — and having reasons for those choices. It is not just a matter of binding ourself, but binding ourself by norms.

It is a move from life passively happening to actively made.


## The three virtues of a programmer

### Laziness

The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don’t have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer. Also hence, this book. See also impatience and hubris.

### Impatience

The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don’t just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and hubris.

### Hubris
Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won’t want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and impatience.

– Larry Wall
