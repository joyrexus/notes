* **Department of Labor Mine Maps** - Over 200 Tennessee shaft mines (mostly in
  Cumberland Plateau and mostly abandoned - are mapped in this collection.
  There does not appear to be an in-house register to these maps. They seem to
  be early 20th century and are filed by mine name, which usually is the name
  of the company that operated the shaft. Contact the manuscript archivist of
  the [Comptroller's Office responsible for GIS Data Sales](https://www.comptroller.tn.gov/OnlineMap/gis_sales.aspx) for additional info.
