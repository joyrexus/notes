# History of Mining in Grundy County

> Excerpts from James L. Nicholson's [History of Grundy County](http://archive.org/stream/tennesseecountyh31nich/tennesseecountyh31nich_djvu.txt) (part of the **Tennessee County History Series**, MEMPHIS STATE UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1982).


## The Coal Discovery 

One other story needs still to be related to complete this 
chapter on early settlers and founders. This is a story in which 
someone finds something which provides the basis for the 
founding of the greatest industry that Grundy County has had 
to this day. 

By the mid- 1840s a few early settlers had established them- 
selves in the vicinity of the future location of Tracy City, then 
still covered with forests abounding with deer and other game. 
One settler was Benjamin Wooten, who had moved to the moun- 
tain from Warren County. His place was situated up in what 
Tracy City people call "The Heading." 

Here Wooten planted each year a patch of about two acres 
of corn. A great find was made one day in this corn field, ac- 
cording to an account given years later by Wooten's son Thomas. 
"One fall," he recalled, "some groundhogs began to destroy our 
crop, and we got after one and treed it under a sourwood .... 
While scratching and digging after the groundhog, we unearthed 
a black substance resembling rich dirt." 

The "rich dirt" proved, of course, to be coal. It was found 
very near the spot where, little more than a decade later, a great 
mine named Wooten No. 1 would be put down by northern 
investors. In the meantime, Ben Wooten and his boys had been 
picking out a little coal and taking it off from time to time to 
peddle to blacksmiths in the valley toward Winchester. 


## Marketing Tracy City Coal 

For the first few years nobody was very enthusiastic about 
Ben Wooten's "black diamint." Forests were everywhere, making 
wood plenteous for cooking and heating. Elsewhere in Tennes- 
see, wood still was being used in the ironmaking process. Fur- 
thermore, there were no rails laid yet over which steam locomotives 
might haul coal to the furnaces of northern Middle Tennessee. 
In fact, the locomotives that were beginning to run elsewhere 
were themselves wood-burners, as were the steamboats that 
plied the great rivers — the Cumberland, Tennessee, Ohio, and 
the mighty Mississippi. Thus it is doubtful that anyone on Cum- 
berland Mountain saw the future awaiting Mr. Wooten's coal. 

However, one day in the year 1850, someone arrived on the 
mountain who had glimpsed that future. He was a young Irish- 
man named Leslie Kennedy, one of the immigrants taking flight 
during the potato famine in his native country. In all likelihood 
Kennedy reached the Cumberland Plateau on the Nashville 
stage and then began hiking over the tableland. In the course 
of his trek, he found outcroppings of coal. Subsequent events 
suggest that the coal Kennedy saw included that of Benjamin 
Wooten. Something in his experience — what we do not know — 
made him know the potentialities of this mineral, and he re- 
turned to Nashville seeking someone to finance the exploitation 
of his discovery. He succeeded in arousing the cupidity of an 
attorney practicing in the capital, William N. Bilbo, who accom- 
panied Kennedy on a return trip to the forest wilderness where 
he had found coal. 

Bilbo was impressed. He bought up Wooten's coal land; and 
he bought more land from the heirs of Samuel Barrell, Felix 
Grundy's partner. Then he went to New York city in search of 
financiers whom he could persuade to raise the money which 
would be needed to develop coal mines in Tennessee. He found 
five such men — four of them capitalists and the fifth a civil en- 
gineer. Their leader was Samuel Franklin Tracy, a merchant 
whose firm was located at 52 University Place; the others were 
J. Bridges, John Daw, Nicholas Fesedder, and William Warne. 

In 1852, after Tracy and several other New Yorkers had 
come to Tennessee to inspect the property, it was purchased 
from Bilbo for a figure said to have been $50,000. Then a charter 
of incorporation was obtained from the State of Tennessee for 
the Sewanee Mining Company. Offices for this new firm were 
located at 26 1 /2 Broadway, the heart of the commercial district 
in Manhattan, New York. The company was capitalized at 
$1,500,000, with paid-in capital of $400,000. It owned 17,950 
acres outright and the mineral and timber rights to another 
3780 acres, the most productive of which would prove to be in 
Grundy County. Tracy later would use land where the coal was 
found to be of little value for the purpose of expressing 
corporate generosity. 

Northern investors in the coal fields of the Cumberland Pla- 
teau did not commit themselves to such a costly venture without 
knowing that a means was at hand by which they could ship their 
product to market. The day of the railroad was dawning. In fact, 
the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad had begun laying its 
rails before the Sewanee Mining Company was incorporated 
and had run its first passenger train the few miles from Nashville 
out to Antioch on April 13, 1851. In the months thereafter, 
building continued apace mile by mile, extending the rails to 
Murfreesboro, Wartrace, Tullahoma, Decherd, and Cowan, enroute 
to the Tennessee-Alabama line, below which the new 
tracks would follow the Tennessee River into Chattanooga. By 
January 6, 1854, the main line was completed between Nashville 
and Chattanooga; and by July, with the problem of landslides 
overcome, the two cities were said to be "securely united by rails." 
It is interesting to note that the president of the Nashville and 
Chattanooga and the man called "the real builder of the road" 
was Vernon K. Stevenson, son-in-law to John M. Bass, in turn 
the son-in-law of Felix Grundy. 

The vision of the investors in the Sewanee Mining Company 
was to supply coal to a vast region from Nashville southeast to 
Charleston and Savannah — a dream which could become a real- 
ity upon the completion of the Nashville and Chattanooga and 
the Memphis and Charleston railroads. Up to that time Nash- 
ville, for example, had depended on Pennsylvania coal coming 
down the Ohio River and then up the Cumberland, the latter at 
times uncertain due to low water. Cost of this coal was as much 
as $ 1 2 per ton. When its Cumberland Mountain branch line con- 
nected with the N&C, the company would be able to offer Nash- 
ville a cheaper and more dependable coal supply. 

It was from near Cowan that the Sewanee Mining Company 
constructed its branch railroad. This branch leaves the main 
road at the tunnel two miles southeast of Cowan. A mountain 
railroader of the late nineteenth century, W. W. Knight, has left 
a description of the branch road in its ascent of the plateau. The 
line, he wrote, "was dubbed the 'Goat Road' because it ascends 
the Cumberland Mountain for a distance of six miles of almost 
continuous reverse curves at a grade of 1 12 feet per mile." 

As this precipitous road was being engineered, the Sewanee 
company was developing its first mines at a place called Coal 
Bank. **The precise location of these mines is unknown today, but 
it is believed that they were in Franklin County, in the present 
St. Andrews-Midway vicinity, just a few miles from where the 
Goat Road achieved the summit of the mountain where Sewanee 
is today.** By 1856 the branch had been completed up the moun- 
tain and some coal had been mined, permitting the first ship- 
ments to be made. 

No sooner, however, was the company in production than it 
encountered a serious problem requiring another large capital 
investment. Neither the quantity nor the quality of the coal from 
the Coal Bank mines was satisfactory. Thus the decision was 
made to extend the branch line 10 miles farther along the pla- 
teau, to the very site where Thomas Wooten had unearthed coal 
while digging for a groundhog. Wooten No. 1 was put down, 
and by November 8, 1858, the first shipment of coal from this 
mine was on the rails. In the meantime, the town of Tracy City, 
named for the president of the Sewanee Mining Company, had 
come into existence. A post office opened at this place September 
14, 1858. 


## Flush Times in Tracy City (1870-1910) 

Certainly Bledsoe's 1864 raid on Tracy City did the mining 
property there little good; the raid, plus the wear and tear of 
four years with little upkeep, left the Tennessee Coal and Rail- 
road (TCR) holdings in a run-down condition at the end of the 
war. Fortunately the firm had fallen into the hands of a skillful 
promoter, A. S. Colyar, who described himself as being in 1866 
"sole owner, without credit, without markets." Yet within little 
more than a year after the end of hostilities, Colyar had coal 
moving again by rail out of Tracy City. First, he had satisfied the 
New York creditors by means of a $220,000 stock issue. Then he 
had installed P. A. Marbury as general manager and gone to 
work himself selling the market on Sewanee coal — and, shortly, 
the coke made from it. E. O. Nathurst, a native of Sweden who 
had come in 1865 to live at Summers Place (later Summerfield), 
and in time would rise to a ranking company official, contracted 
with the TCR to supply most of the crossties used in restoring 
the railroad track between Tracy City and Cowan. By June of 
1866 production had been resumed; 9240 tons of coal were 
shipped before the year was out. 

All around, the South lay in ruins. Just 20 miles to the north, 
for example, old John Armfield was making the rounds swear- 
ing out attachment bills against gentlemen who had been cottage 
owners and stockholders of the Beersheba Springs Company. 
All personages of wealth and repute a few years before, they 
were now dead or ruined. This death and destruction had been 
wrought by the industrial North, and it is not surprising that a 
place which was endowed with the resources needed for indus- 
trialism would be among the first phoenixes to rise from the 
ashes of the Old South. Few persons, however, foresaw in 1866 
that tiny Tracy City, wrecked by war, was about to become just 
about the most thriving place between Nashville and Chatta- 
nooga. In the end it had to relinquish to Birmingham the so- 
briquet "Pittsburgh of the South," yet Tracy City saw the day 
when it was headquarters of what would become the Tennessee 
Coal and Iron Division of U.S. Steel. 

It seems to have been Colyar who realized the future of coke. 
The prewar iron furnaces of Tennessee had used charcoal for 
smelting, but in the North coke had begun to be used by the 
1840s and definitely was the fuel of the future for the iron and 
steel industry. Using primitive pits on the ground, the TCR con- 
verted 5377 bushels of coke as early as 1868. Then, in 1873, 
Samuel E. Jones erected in Tracy City at a cost of $3000 the fa- 
mous Fiery Gizzard coke iron furnace. Built as an experiment, 
the furnace collapsed soon after the coke was blown in; but 15 
tons of iron were produced — the first coke iron in the history of 
Tennessee — demonstrating that Sewanee coal could be con- 
verted to iron-producing coke. By 1875 the production of the 
TCR grew to 109,100 tons of coal and 16,160 tons of coke, and 
by 1880 to 114, 170tonsof coal and 64,440 tonsof coke. By 1876 
TCR property was valued at a million dollars, and it included 2 1 
miles of railroad track, five locomotives, 150 coal cars, 400 min- 
ers' cars, and 120 coke ovens. The monthly output grossed 
$30,000. 

The early coke was made in those 120 ovens built in 1873 in 
the vicinity of the present county garage. Tending the ovens was 
convict labor, which, beginning in 1870, the Tennessee Coal and 
Railroad Company leased from the State of Tennessee at the rate 
of one dollar a day, plus keep, for each convict. The first stockade 
in which these men — most of them black — were housed was the 
same structure used during the war by the 20th Connecticut 
Volunteers. For nearly a generation the presence of convicts was 
very much a part of life in Tracy City. Writing from there on July 
10, 1871, to her husband Leslie Kennedy — the same who first 
told the world of Ben Wooten's coal and 2 1 years later was on his 
only return visit to his native Ireland — Mrs. Kennedy reported, 
"The convicts are pegging away as usual. Two of them took it 
into their heads yesterday to escape, which they succeed(ed) in 
doing." Then there is this stanza from an old work song of local 
origin: "Warden went down to Nashville,/ Stepped up to the 
pen,/ Said to the Nashville warden,/ 'I want fifty of your best 
men,/ Want to take them to Tracy/ To work in the Lone Rock 
Mines.'/ Buddy, roll down the line./ Buddy, roll down the line." 
Old miners interviewed some years ago told of convicts being 
whipped for not finishing what was called their weekly "task." 
The rate of mortality amongst them was said to be high. Those 
who perished were buried on a ridge above the coke ovens, still 
known locally as "Nigger Hill. "To the free miners and workmen 
of Tracy City, the extensive use of convict labor by the company 
was a festering sore, which in 1892 finally would come to a head. 
In the meantime, TCR production of both coal and coke was 
increasing annually and Tracy City was prospering. The two 
men who seem to have been chiefly responsible for giving pos- 
itive direction to the town's development for a quarter century 
were the Swede, Einar Oswald Nathurst (1836-1903) and Alfred 
Montgomery Shook (1845-1923), a Confederate veteran who 
came to Tracy City from Franklin County soon after the war. 
Each man built himself a fine dwelling near the business district, 
and both were determined that Tracy City would not become 
another ugly mining camp. Nathurst himself managed the 
Building Association and was responsible for constructing many 
of the pleasant and attractive frame houses which went up in the 
last decades of the nineteenth century. In 1889 Shook took it 
upon himself to provide the town with a magnificent public 
school. When the Inman interests acquired the Tennessee Coal 
and Railroad Company in 1882 and it became the Tennessee 
Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TCI), Shook was made gen- 
eral manager and Nathurst superintendent. 

The census of 1890 revealed that the population of Grundy 
County had more than doubled since the war to 6345. The num- 
ber of Tracy Citians had surpassed 1200. A business and profes- 
sional register for the year 1887 gives evidence of a thriving 
place. There were four physicians (three more than in 1980) — 
Dr. E. W. Bailey, Dr. L. P. Barber, Dr. C. F. Hutton, and Dr. R. B. 
Owens; one dentist — Dr. W. E. Tillett; and two druggists — H. C. 
Johnston and the Park 8c Roddy firm. There were five grocers 
and eight general and dry goods stores. Albert Colyar was keep- 
ing a hotel in Tracy City; M. V. Hoke was the jeweler, J. M. Daniel 
the photographer, and J. R. DeLuta the barber. Edward von 
Bergen from the Swiss Colony was selling furniture, and W. R. 
Hunt had a little of everything — lumber, furniture, coffins, gro- 
ceries, saddles, and harness. David McClure and J. E. Smith were 
blacksmiths, and J. H. Northcutt kept the livery stable. At the 
depot — operated after its purchase of the branch line in 1887 
by the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad — E. L. 
Hampton was the ticket agent and T M. C. White the express 
agent. Finally, the town had gained its first newspaper, The Tracy 
City News, the year before, in 1886. 

The general prosperity derived, of course, from the local 
mining and coking enterprise. In the very year of 1887, the his- 
torian Goodspeed was calling the Tracy City mine "the most ex- 
tensive in the state." Another writer also had glowing words. 
"Practically," he wrote, "the mine is inexhaustible, and as pure 
coal, valuable alike for grates and manufacturing — making iron 
as well as steam." It was averred that 25,000 acres of the com- 
pany's land was "underlaid with the Sewanee seam of coal, rang- 
ing from two to seven feet in thickness." The company which 
owned these rich lands was reorganized in 1876. Colyar re- 
mained president, but ownership was in association with Thomas 
O'Connor, William Morrow, and W H. Cherry. Their firm com- 
pleted an iron furnace at Cowan — Colyar's dream at the time — 
in 1881. 

Early the next year, the company sold its operations at Tracy 
City and Cowan to John H. Inman and associates of New York 
City, with the Tennessee stockholders retaining one-third own- 
ership and local men like Nathurst and Shook being placed in 
charge of operations. The Inman interests soon added to their 
holdings the Southern States Coal, Iron and Land Company, 
Limited, one operation of which was a blast furnace at South 
Pittsburg. Then, in 1886, they acquired the Pratt Coal and Iron 
Company in Alabama. By this purchase the TCI became owner 
of the Linn Iron Company, the Alice Furnace Company, 460 
coke ovens, two blast furnaces, 76,000 acres of coal lands and an 
additional 13,000 acres containing IV2 miles of the Red Moun- 
tain iron ore seam outcropping. At the time probably few per- 
sons realized it, but the acquisition in Alabama, where all 
components of iron and steel manufacture were located proxi- 
mately, foreshadowed the day when TCI officials would deem 
their Tennessee holdings expendable. Among these was Tracy 
City, the original home of the company, owing to continuing con- 
flicts with the miners of the place. 

In July of 1892 the TCI had 320 convicts working continu- 
ously in its Tracy City operations, which by then included 130 
additional coke ovens built at Lone Rock in 1883. Among the 
free miners, who were not nearly so numerous as the convicts, 
there was growing unrest at having to compete with them for 
jobs. Early Saturday morning, August 13, 1892, the bad feeling 
surfaced. A committee of miners went to Superintendent Nat- 
hurst and demanded more work. Nathurst replied that he be- 
lieved he could assure them of more within 30 days and tried to 
placate the men. Words, however, were not enough for the min- 
ers that day, and at 8:30 a.m. 150 of them marched on the Lone 
Rock stockade in the present Grundy Lakes vicinity. Many were 
armed and they quickly forced open the stockade — perhaps with 
the help of several guards disgruntled over having recently been 
fired. The miners next removed company equipment to a safe 
distance and brought out the convicts under cover of their weap- 
ons. Then they fired the stockade, burning it to the ground. 
After the miners had taken control from the guards of the con- 
victs already at work that morning, they marched them to the 
depot, loaded them into boxcars, and ordered an engineer to 
take them to Cowan and from there send them on to Nashville. 
Between Monteagle and Sewanee, prisoners uncoupled one car 
and 13 of them made a break. At least one was killed and two 
wounded, but six escaped. The rest were taken back to the pen- 
itentiary on a special train sent to Cowan. 

In the wake of the miners' uprising, Governor John P. Buch- 
anan offered to send troops to Tracy City; local officials, how- 
ever, said they were not needed because the convicts, the cause 
of the trouble, had been removed. The TCI, however, was not 
ready to give up using convict labor, and soon some were back. 
Two years later (August of 1894) it was the prisoners who mu- 
tinied. In this uprising a deputy warden, W. H. Nelson, and con- 
vict Pete Hamilton both were slain. In December of 1895 the 
miners struck on account of the continuing convict lease sys- 
tem — a strike which seems at last to have gained its end, for when 
the leases expired the next month (January 1 , 1 896), the convicts 
were removed for good. Soon after another milestone passed 
more quietly when Tracy City's first mines, opened almost 40 
years before, closed, exhausted; a little later the coke ovens 
nearby, those built in 1873, were shut down. 

Unfortunately, the final departure of convict laborers after 
25 years did not end the trouble between TCI and the miners. 
If anything, it was intensified. Strikes were frequent. E. C. Nat- 
hurst, who seems to have been an ameliorating influence, re- 
signed as superintendent July 1, 1903, and died before the year 
was out. He was succeeded by J. H. Ferguson. The following 
year matters were unsettled for several months before the cli- 
max was reached. There had been no contract for some time 
and little work. Then, in June of 1904, TCI suddenly closed its 
Tracy City mines altogether and began moving some employees 
and mining gear — also a carload of mules — to Birmingham. In 
December Ferguson resigned as superintendent; TCI was ready 
to unload its Tennessee holdings. By April arrangements had 
been made to transfer all its Tracy City Division property to E. 
L. Hampton, NC&StL station agent. Within days the Tennessee 
Consolidated Coal Company (TCC) had been organized and was 
in possession of the former TCI holdings. This company would 
continue to operate extensive mines in Grundy County until the 
coal field disturbances early in the 1960s, and would keep its 
offices in Tracy City until 1969. However, the departure of Ten- 
nessee Coal and Iron to Birmingham cast a long shadow across 
the future of Tracy City. This change occurred when the town 
was enjoying its heyday and for awhile was scarcely noticed, but 
it made a decline inevitable. 

The new company was no more successful than the old in 
bringing peace to the coal fields of Grundy County. Nationwide 
it was a time of ferment among miners, with the UMW under 
the leadership of John Mitchell active in organizing and carrying 
out successful strikes. Despite this climate, Tennessee Consoli- 
dated did not act to work out a contract but employed nonunion 
miners. Trouble erupted in a hail of gunfire Thursday, August 
24, 1905. Nonunion miners under the supervision of Dick Hen- 
ley and Jim Rust were cleaning the entrance of Reid Hill mine 
(near the present Fiery Gizzard Sportsman's clubhouse). Shots 
rang out from a nearby brush thicket. Henley and Rust fell mor- 
tally wounded; John McGovern also was hit but survived. Fol- 
lowing these murders the homes both of union and nonunion 
men were fired into. There were stories of a secret organization 
of miners sworn to obedience and fraternal loyalty. 

On August 27, in response to the murders and out of fear 
of more violence, Governor John I. Cox ordered six companies 
of the Third National Guard Regiment into Tracy City "to show 
the power of the state and to maintain law and order." He also 
went there himself and spoke at the Miners' Hall. In his speech 
Cox recognized "the right to organize," but also the right of the 
nonunion man to work. In tents pitched in front of Shook School 
the guardsmen remained through October, their bivouac called 
Camp Estelle after a daughter of A. M. Shook. In the meantime, 
two men were arrested in connection with the murders, but no 
one ever was convicted of the crimes. Not until July of 1906 did 
the miners and TCC enter into a two-year contract. 


## Twentieth Century Mining Towns (1904-1917) 


#### Coalmont 

By the end of the nineteenth century, the once thick veins of 
Sewanee coal in the earliest mines of the Tracy City vicinity were 
playing out. In 1 896 Tennessee Coal and Iron officials indicated 
that they were about to close such exhausted mines as old Woo- 
ten No. 1. Yet this announcement certainly did not signal total 
depletion of the vast coal reserves of the mountain, only that 
operations must shift to untapped veins and that new shafts 
must be put down. With the opening of these mines in the first 
years of the twentieth century, railroad tracks fanned out from 
Tracy City — to Clouse Hill, to Nunley Ridge and Flat Branch, 
to Pryor Ridge. 

The Sewanee Coal, Coke, & Land Company invested in the 
mines at Clouse Hill north of Tracy City. About 1903 this firm 
began taking steps to develop its property several miles farther 
north at a locale known as Coal Dale. Work was begun on the 
railroad to this place, which by June had had its name changed 
to Coalmont. Labor contractors recruited black workmen to lay 
the tracks to Coalmont and brought them to the mountain in 
groups as large as 80. These laborers, along with their "camp 
followers," lived in camps set up along the route. From time to 
time there was trouble. The first fatal altercation took place in 
January of 1904, when one John Duncan shot and killed Kate 
Thomas and was himself wounded by John "Black Diamond" 
Key. Despite such occurrences, the laying of the rails was com- 
pleted by March of 1904. In the meantime, a post office had been 
established at Coalmont on August 14, 1903. 

The new coal town flourished. Its correspondent for Mrs. 
Grundy, the Tracy City newspaper, boasted that Coalmont had 
"the best class of miners to be found at any coal camp in the 
state." The only problem was that the Sewanee Coal, Coke, & 
Land Company could not find enough such men. "Fifty to 100 
more practical miners to dig coal would be welcomed," the cor- 
respondent affirmed, pointing out also that "the new (coke) 
ovens are not all burning because of a scarcity of slack occasioned 
by a lack of miners." 

The Episcopalians established the first church at Coalmont, 
consecrating St. Albans Chapel in September of 1904 (it was 
maintained till September 1951). By the fall of 1906, Professor 
Will Campbell was holding school for about 50 pupils, although 
it was March of 1908 before a building erected for a school, as 
such, was ready for use. That same month the Tracy City news- 
paperman Ike Woodward had a moving picture show going, and 
for added entertainment a skating rink had opened. The Red 
Man, a popular lodge of the period, also organized a Coalmont 
chapter. 

In September of 1908 the Sewanee Fuel & Iron Company 
bought out the holdings of Sewanee Coal, Coke, 8c Land. The 
buyers continued to produce coal from the Coalmont mines and 
to convert to coke in its ovens for about the next 30 years. These 
productive facilities did not change hands again until November 
of 1939, when they were acquired by the Coalmont Coal and 
Coke Company, of which John E. Patton was president. This 
firm operated through most of World War II, up into 1944. The 
property since has changed hands several times, but the ovens 
(reopened briefly in 1951) and the mines have been shut down 
for a generation now. 

Wheareas the coal mines of Tracy City carried the names of 
locales and individuals, or were given such colorful designations 
as Rattlesnake, Possum Tail, and Wildcat, those at Coalmont 
were named systematically, making use of the letters of the al- 
phabet. They were A Mine, B Mine, C Mine, and so on up to G 
Mine. B Mine, located under Sweeton Hill, was the most exten- 
sively worked. Tracks laid from A Mine enabled coal to be carried 
by car to the washer, which was at the tipples near the coke ovens. 
These abandoned facilities are to be found along the old tracks, 
just west of where they cross present Highway 56. 

About 20 to 25 black men provided much of the labor at the 
coke ovens. They and their families lived nearby in "the Negro 
Quarters," which numbered about a dozen dwellings in addition 
to a structure which did double duty as church and school. 
Blacks abandoned Coalmont in the 1920s, according to accounts 
of older residents. Following a pushing incident between blacks 
and whites at the company commissary, a black man was killed 
on the hill near St. Albans Chapel. Soon the Quarters stood 
empty. 

Today Coalmont's oldest continuing institution is the Coal- 
mont Savings Bank. It was established April 12, 1921, with assets 
totaling a mere $25,543. However, its first home was a fine brick 
building with a red tile roof which served for years as the com- 
mercial hub of Coalmont. The bank shared the first floor with 
the post office, convenient for Arthur R. Curtis, who served ten- 
ures both as cashier of the bank and postmaster. On the second 
floor were the offices of the Sewanee Fuel & Iron Company. Mr. 
Curtis is given much of the credit for enabling the bank to 
weather the Depression, the deepest trough of which was ex- 
perienced locally in the years 1930-1935. The Coalmont Savings 
Bank has enjoyed a steady growth since World War II and today 
has a spacious new building in Coalmont and branches at Tracy 
City, Altamont, and Palmer. Lon S. Varnell, former owner of the 
Chevrolet dealership in Tracy City and now an entertainment 
promoter in Nashville, became chairman of the bank's board of 
directors in 1972. John E. Curtis (son of Arthur R.) has served 
a long tenure as president. 

Other landmarks of the years when Coalmont flourished are 
gone. Both the depot and St. Alban's Chapel were dismantled 
early in the 1950s. The mishaps of time also have claimed the 
commissary and the well-known Wigwam Hotel. 


####  Palmer 

Several months before President Wilson took the United 
States into World War I, officials of Tennessee Consolidated Coal 
Company reached an opportune decision. They did not know 
that demand for coal was about to reach record levels owing to 
a war economy, but they did know that depletion of their re- 
serves around Tracy City dictated that they begin to develop the 
large fields that TCC owned to the northeast. These were on the 
mountain in the eastern extreme of Crundy County, which in 
1917 was a sparsely settled area accessible to the more populous 
southern part of the county only by difficult mountain roads. To 
get coal out, it would be necessary to extend the branch railroad 
eastward about 13 miles from Coalmont, its terminus since 1904. 

Accordingly, in January of 1917, the president of the Nash- 
ville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railroad announced plans for 
what was called "the first really new railroad construction in Ten- 
nessee in years." Once again black laborers were brought to the 
mountain to lay track, and as the work progressed, they occu- 
pied at least four camps along the route. In the same months 
that the rails were being extended, TCC was opening its new 
mines in the Hill Creek vicinity not far from the old east Crundy 
community of Tatesville. The post office at Tatesville dated back 
to 1880 when Henry Overturf, a Confederate veteran of the 
35th Tennessee Infantry, was appointed postmaster. 

The railroad to Palmer was completed and the mines were ready to 
operate in time to begin moving out coal in the war year 1918. 
This large operation would continue to produce coal until 
the early 1960s when a dispute between the United Mine Work- 
ers and Tennessee Consolidated, attended by bloodshed and 
destruction of property, led to a permanent shutdown. At their 
peak the Palmer mines employed over 700 men and produced 
hundreds of carloads of coal each week, far in excess of the 800 
tons per day average of the Tracy City mines in the 1858-1917 
period. For many years Everett Roberts superintended TCC's 
Palmer operation. 

The town of Palmer (locally pronounced "PAR-mer") grew up around 
Tennessee Consolidated's new operation. Early residents recall 
that the place took its name from a family who lived 
in a large house where the company store later was built. The 
town was mapped by a civil engineer from New York named 
Foust. He proceeded section by section, giving each locale a col- 
orful name which probably derived from some personal expe- 
rience or observation in that portion of his survey. Mr. Foust's 
names included Duck Town, Chigger Town, and Burnt Orchard. 

Dwellings for miners and their families were being built in 
1917, and newcomers from far and wide soon were moving in. 
It did not take long for the population of Palmer to exceed 1000 
and for it thus to become the second most populous place in the 
county's history. Moreover, its daytime population was aug- 
mented each morning by the arrival on the early train of miners 
and other company employees who had boarded at Tracy City 
and other points along the route, like Sanders Crossing, Coal- 
mont, Mt. Vernon, and Laager. 

Tennessee Consolidated's coal preparation plant at Palmer 
was the most modern and extensive ever erected in Grundy 
County. In addition, the company built and operated the main 
store in the Palmer business district. There were also a post office 
and a theater downtown. William R. (Bob) Overturf was ap- 
pointed the first postmaster when the post office was established 
there March 24, 1919. He previously had held the same position 
at nearby Tatesville. A fine mountain stone school eventually was 
built several blocks north of downtown Palmer. 

Two other east Grundy locales came into existence with the 
opening of the mines at Palmer. One of these was Laager, located 
on the branch railroad due east of the Swiss Colony at Gruetli. 
The place originally was known as Henley's Switch. It gained this 
name, first, because there had been a switching track near where 
State Highway 108 crossed the old tracks until they were taken 
up in the 1970s. Secondly, the name Henley derived from the 
J. C. Henley general merchandise store near the switch. In those 
early days of the place, there was also a stave mill nearby on land 
which had been owned by Jackson Tate, who, with Mrs. Tate, 
operated a boarding house in the community. Other early set- 
tiers were Dave Dykes, Porter Rankin, Harrison and George 
Ross, Tim Tate, and a Swiss settler named Laager.
